## [**Capstone Project in Computer Vision: Malaria Detection**](https://github.com/Thurmos/Thurman_Portfolio/blob/main/Thurman_Falk_Notebook_Malaria_Detection_Full_Code.ipynb)

Problem Formulation: Determine the feasibility of computer vision for diagnosing Malaria. The approach will be to evaluate a number of convolutional neural networks using standard arcitectures and modeling to see if they have acceptable accuracy. Recommend the best model to use in diagnosing Malaria. 

## [Deep Learning Project Street Number Digit Recognition (SVHN)](https://github.com/Thurmos/Thurman_Portfolio/blob/main/Thurman_Falk_High_Code_SVHN_Digit_Recognition.ipynb)

Problem Formulation: The SVHN dataset contains over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from street-level photos created by Google. IDevelop a model to predict the number depicted inside the image by using Artificial or Fully Connected Feed Forward Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks.
