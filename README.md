## [**Capstone Project in Computer Vision: Malaria Detection**](https://github.com/Thurmos/Thurman_Portfolio/blob/main/Thurman_Falk_Notebook_Malaria_Detection_Full_Code.ipynb)

Problem Formulation: Determine the feasibility of computer vision for diagnosing Malaria. The approach will be to evaluate a number of convolutional neural networks using standard arcitectures and modeling to see if they have acceptable accuracy. Recommend the best model to use in diagnosing Malaria.
