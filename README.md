## [Capstone Project in Computer Vision: Malaria Detection](https://github.com/Thurmos/Thurman_Portfolio/blob/main/Thurman_Falk_Notebook_Malaria_Detection_Full_Code.ipynb)

Problem Formulation: Determine the feasibility of computer vision for diagnosing Malaria. The approach will be to evaluate a number of convolutional neural networks using standard architectures and modeling to see if they have acceptable accuracy. Recommend the best model to use in diagnosing Malaria.

## [Deep Learning Project Street Number Digit Recognition (SVHN)](https://github.com/Thurmos/Thurman_Portfolio/blob/main/Thurman_Falk_High_Code_SVHN_Digit_Recognition.ipynb)

Problem Formulation: The SVHN dataset contains over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from street-level photos created by Google. Develop a model to predict the number depicted inside the image by using Artificial or Fully Connected Feed Forward Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks.

## [SuperKart Machine Learning Linear Regression Model](https://github.com/Thurman-Falk/Thurman_Portfolio/blob/main/SuperKart_Linear_Regression.ipynb)
Problem Formulation:  Use EDA and machine learning with a linear regression model to predict store sales.  Cross validation was performed to increase model accuracy and the assumptions of linear regression were verified. The linear regression model achieved an R squared of 0.82.

## [Hotel Cancellation Machine Learning Classification](https://github.com/Thurman-Falk/Thurman_Portfolio/blob/main/Hotel_Booking_Cancellation_Prediction.ipynb)
Problem Formulation:  Use EDA and machine learning classification models to predict whether a guest is going to cancel their booking.  Decision trees and random forest models were tested with hyperparameter tuning to reduce overfitting. The best classification model was a decision tree, which achieved a recall of 84%.

## [Relative Retention Time Table Generator App](https://github.com/Thurman-Falk/Thurman_Portfolio/blob/main/RRT_Generator_App.ipynb)
Problem Formulation: Tables need to be compiled for chromatography data that relate the size of an impurity to the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Additionally, the time the impurity is observed can vary, so it is reported by time relative to the acitve ingredient, this is a reliable indicator.  The App automatically calculates percent area and relative retention time for every impurity, and then makes a table that has percent areas aligned by the relative retention time.  The App can easily save an analyst 6 hours of work each utilzation.

The Application makes advanced use of Pandas and Numpy, as well as custom functions.  Tkinter GUI is used to build the user interface so the application may be helpful to scientists unfamiliar with coding.
