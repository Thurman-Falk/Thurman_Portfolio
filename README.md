## [Capstone Project in Computer Vision: Malaria Detection](https://github.com/Thurmos/Thurman_Portfolio/blob/main/Thurman_Falk_Notebook_Malaria_Detection_Full_Code.ipynb)

Problem Formulation: Determine the feasibility of computer vision for diagnosing Malaria. The approach will be to evaluate a number of convolutional neural networks using standard architectures and modeling to see if they have acceptable accuracy. Recommend the best model to use in diagnosing Malaria.

## [Deep Learning Project Street Number Digit Recognition (SVHN)](https://github.com/Thurmos/Thurman_Portfolio/blob/main/Thurman_Falk_High_Code_SVHN_Digit_Recognition.ipynb)

Problem Formulation: The SVHN dataset contains over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from street-level photos created by Google. Develop a model to predict the number depicted inside the image by using Artificial or Fully Connected Feed Forward Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks.

## [SuperKart Machine Learning Linear Regression Model](https://github.com/Thurman-Falk/Thurman_Portfolio/blob/main/SuperKart_Linear_Regression.ipynb)
Problem Formulation:  Use EDA and machine learning with a linear regression model to predict store sales.  Cross validation was performed to increase model accuracy and the assumptions of linear regression were verified. The linear regression model achieved an R squared of 0.82.
